
PCSX-ReARMed - yet another PCSX fork

http://notaz.gp2x.de/pcsx_rearmed.php


About
-----

PCSX ReARMed is yet another PCSX fork based on the PCSX-Reloaded project,
which itself contains code from PCSX, PCSX-df and PCSX-Revolution. This
version is ARM architecture oriented and features MIPS->ARM recompiler by
Ari64. It was created for Pandora handheld, but should be usable on other
devices after some code adjustments.

PCSX ReARMed features GPU plugin from PCSX4ALL project.


Usage
-----

This version features a framebuffer driven menu that can be used to run
games and configure the emulator.

Supported CD image formats:
- .bin/.cue
- .bin/.toc
- .img/.ccd/.sub
- .mdf/.mds
- .Z/.Z.table
- .bz/.bz.table
- .ZNX/.ZNX.table (partial)
- EBOOT.PBP (PSP, partial)

CDDA (CD audio) support requires .cue/.bin format.

The emulator can simulate BIOS, which means BIOS files are not required,
however implementation is not complete and some games still need real BIOS
to work. To use real BIOS, copy uncompressed BIOS files to
[sd card]/pandora/appdata/pcsx_rearmed/bios/
then select the BIOS you want to use in Options->BIOS/Plugins menu.


Plugins
-------

GPU (graphics) and SPU (sound) plugins can be selected in
[BIOS/Plugins] menu:

builtin_gpu    - the P.E.Op.S. GPU plugin, most accurate but slow.
gpuPCSX4ALL.so - plugin from PCSX4ALL project. Faster but has some glitches.
gpuGLES.so     - experimental port of P.E.Op.S. MesaGL plugin to OpenGL ES.
                 Occasionally faster but has lots of glitches and seems to
                 be rather unstable (may crash the system).
builtin_spu    - P.E.Op.S. SPU plugin, most accurate but slow.
spunull.so     - NULL plugin, i.e. no sound emulation.
